# Covid19ReliefDCBot
A Bot for getting Information on Relief Facilities for Covid 19 Patients and Easily Find Services in Emergency.

The Bot is completely Open Source and you can download the Source Code and use it for fair purposes.

#### Inspired by [covid19-twitter.in](https://www.covid19-twitter.in/) - [Github](https://github.com/umanghome/twitter-search-covid19/)

## How to Setup the Bot
* Download the Source Code.
* Make Sure you have Python (3.7 or Newer) Installed on your Device. If not, Install it from the [Official Python Website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
* Make a Bot Application. (More Info at this [Website](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discord.html))
* In the Credentials file ([credentials.json](./bot/data/credentials.json)), fill in the required credentials.
  * In `token`, fill in the Bot's Token you made in Step 3rd.

* The Bot should install all Dependencies by Itself if all the Python and PIP Settings are configured Properly on your Device.

## Some Resources
At the Times, it is our Responsibility to Help anyone we possibly can. Therefore, I shared some links where you can find some Relief Resources for the Patients.
You can share them with the needy and It may help someone. I will update them as I will find more verified Links.
